#### Teaching
I teach a fairly wide range of courses that cover topics including GIS and Remote Sensing, Data Analysis, as well as Introductory and Advanced Physical Geography. In addition I have been fortunate to lead several international off campus courses ranging in length from several weeks to an entire semester. Currently I am working with members of the lab to integrate data science tools and techniques such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) into our cirriculum.<br>
